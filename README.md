## History

- For a description changes, check out the [Change History Page](/docs/change-history.md).

- This project began in 2010 during a [ShipIt](https://www.atlassian.com/company/shipit) day at Atlassian with provider
  to query Jira issues using LINQ syntax. Over time it grew to add many more operations on top of the JIRA SOAP API.
  Support of REST API was added on v4.0 and support of SOAP API was dropped on v8.0.

## Signed Version

### Atlassian.SDK.Signed (Deprecated)

The [Atlassian.SDK.Signed](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Atlassian.SDK.Signed/) package contains a signed version of
the assembly, however it is no longer being mantained. It has the following limitations:

- It references the  [RestSharpSigned](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RestSharpSigned) package, which is not up-to-date
  to the official  [RestSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RestSharpSigned) package.
- It only supports net452 framework (does not support .netcore).

### Using StrongNameSigner

An alternative to using the Atlassian.SDK.Signed package is to use the [StrongNameSigner](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Brutal.Dev.StrongNameSigner) which can automatically sign any un-signed packages in your project. For a sample of how to use it in a project see [VS Jira](https://bitbucket.org/farmas/vsjira).

## Documentation

The documentation is placed under the [docs](/docs) folder.

As a first user, here is the documentation on [how to use the SDK](/docs/how-to-use-the-sdk.md).

## Support

All features tested on JIRA v7.13. If you run into problems using a previous version of JIRA let me know.

Please open an issue if you encounter a bug, have suggestions or feature requests. I'll do my best to address them.
